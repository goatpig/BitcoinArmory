v0.94.99-testing

== Added ==

   - Introducing litenode
   - Client and database are now split in 2 binaries: ArmoryQt (client) and ArmoryDB (server)
   - Clients interface with servers over the FCGI protocol. Server is hardcoded to listen on localhost:9001
   - ArmoryDB can serve remote clients through the use of a HTTP daemon. Example setup for nginx can be found in here: 
     ./nginx_example.conf

   - As a result, bitcoin P2P connectivity has been moved from ArmoryQt to ArmoryDB. This means in turn that clients do not 
     require the presence of a local bitcoin node process to operate.
   - By default ArmoryQt spawns and controls ArmoryDB. This will not happen in 2 cases:
      _ There is already an instance of ArmoryDB listening on localhost:9001
      _ ArmoryQt has been pointed to specific ArmoryDB through a combination of the new --armorydb-ip and --armorydb-port 
        command line arguments
   - ArmoryDB requires the presence of a bitcoin node on localhost:8333 and access to raw blockchain data like before.
     The change to interface with bitcoin nodes remotely (blocks over p2p) is not in the scope of this release
   - ArmoryDB comes with its own set of command line arguments. They are described here:  
     ./cppForSwig/BlockUtils.cpp:778

   - DB modes are selected with the new --db-type cli arg. It defaults to --db-type=DB_FULL. Also available are DB_BARE and
     DB_SUPER. DB has not effect currently, it will be implemented in a future release.   
   - Introduced an extra set of data to resolve random transaction hashes. This database is ~550MB with the current
     blockchain size. This comes in addition to the previous db features of 0.94. This is the default mode, i.e. DB_FULL. 
     To disable this feature (revert to the bare 0.94 db), use --db-type=DB_BARE.
   - You cannot swap db modes on top of an existing db, you will need to build one from scratch instead.

   - ArmoryDB now uses its own log file (dbLog.txt), running in the --datadir folder
   - 0.95 db format changed from 0.94, you will have to build it in another --dbdir
   - Added DB version detection. Mismatch in DB version will result in an error message and termination on the client side,
     a stdout warning on the server terminal side as well as in the db log file.

   - new cli args have been introduced to control db resource consumption:
     _ --ram_usage: int >= 1. Defaults to 4. Each point is worth ~128MB RAM on top of the baseline needs. There is no upper
       bound, be careful when using high values. <= 0 values result in use of default.
     _ --thread-count: int >= 1. Defaults to CPU max thread count. As with ram-usage, use large upper values with care.

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed the missing transaction issue in Tx detail dialog through the addition of the new resolver dataset

== Removed ==
   - ArmoryQt does not interface nor require the presence of a local bitcoin node to operate online anymore. This 
     functionality has been migrated to ArmoryDB
   - There will be no changes to wallet crypto related operations in this version. Older offline versions of Armory
     (down to 0.92.x) are still compatible with 0.95


v0.94.1, released April 2nd 2016:

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed parsing new blocks with no wallet loaded
   - Fixed wallet/address import
   - Fixed address sweeping
   - .deb installer: will not register shortcuts if /usr/share/desktop-directories is missing

== Removed ==
   - Removed Bitcoin P2P alert parsing, as it was removed from Bitcoin Core.

v0.94.0, released March 27th 2016:

== Added ==
   - New database format: DB shrinked from 60GB to sub 200MB, >10x initial setup and startup speed.
   - New DB corruption detection and auto repair code. Bad block issues should be mostly gone.
   - Detection and GUI flagging of RBF enabled zero confirmation transactions. 
   - Fixed ZC chain handling and replacement. All ZC spending ZC outputs are now flagged as replaceable, 
     regardless of TxIn sequence or parent Tx state.
   - Added new GUI option to add additional entropy at wallet creation using a deck of cards.
   - After the change in lead, all new code is now developed under the MIT license (was AGPL3).

== Removed ==
   - No more phone home code. There are no plans to reintroduce any code of that nature.
   - As a result, the announce tab code is gone.
   - No more torrent code. Seedboxes were hosted by ATI and are now down. Also, IBD improvements in 
     Core 0.10-12 make this code obsolete.
   - As a result of the new light weight DB, the TxHint set has been shrinked to the bare minimum. This means
     Armory cannot resolve arbitrary TxHash to data in block anymore. The main symptom is the inability to 
     resolve TxIn data in the "Transcation Details" dialog. This feature will be reintroduced as part of an
     intermediarry DB format inbetween fullnode and supernode.
   - No more supernode. Will be reintroduced in a later version.
