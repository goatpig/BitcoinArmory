v0.94.0, released March 27th 2016:

== Added ==
   - New database format: DB shrinked from 60GB to sub 200MB, >10x initial setup and startup speed.
   - New DB corruption detection and auto repair code. Bad block issues should be mostly gone.
   - Detection and GUI flagging of RBF enabled zero confirmation transactions. 
   - Fixed ZC chain handling and replacement. All ZC spending ZC outputs are now flagged as replaceable, 
     regardless of TxIn sequence or parent Tx state.
   - Added new GUI option to add additional entropy at wallet creation using a deck of cards.
   - After the change in lead, all new code is now developed under the MIT license (was AGPL3).

== Removed ==
   - No more phone home code. There are no plans to reintroduce any code of that nature.
   - As a result, the announce tab code is gone.
   - No more torrent code. Seedboxes were hosted by ATI and are now down. Also, IBD improvements in 
     Core 0.10-12 make this code obsolete.
   - As a result of the new light weight DB, the TxHint set has been shrinked to the bare minimum. This means
     Armory cannot resolve arbitrary TxHash to data in block anymore. The main symptom is the inability to 
     resolve TxIn data in the "Transcation Details" dialog. This feature will be reintroduced as part of an
     intermediarry DB format inbetween fullnode and supernode.
   - No more supernode. Will be reintroduced in a later version.
